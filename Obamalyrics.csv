Killer Mike,"Our government has a firm policy not to capitulate to terrorist demands. That no-concessions policy remains in force, despite the wildly speculative and false stories about arms for hostages and alleged ransom payments, we did not, repeat, did not trade weapons or anything else for hostages, nor will we,The ballot or the bullet,, some freedom or some bullshit,Will we ever do it big, or keep just settling for little shit,We brag on having bread, but none of us are bakers,We all talk having greens, but none of us own acres,If none of us on acres, and none of us grow wheat,Then who will feed our people when our people need to eat,So it seems our people starve from lack of understanding,Cos all we seem to give them is some balling and some dancing,And some talking about our car and imaginary mansions,We should be indited for bullshit we inciting,Hand the children death and pretend that its exciting,We are advertisements for agony and pain,We exploit the youth, we tell them to join a gang,We tell them dope stories, introduce them to the game,Just like Oliver North introduced us to cocaine,In the 80s when the bricks came on military planes,A few months ago I told the american people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not,The end of the Reagan Era, I'm like number twelver,Old enough to understand the shit'll change forever,They declared the war on drugs like a war on terror,But it really did was let the police terrorize whoever,But mostly black boys,, but they would call us ""niggers"",And lay us on our belly, while they fingers on they triggers,They boots was on our head, they dogs was on our crotches,And they would beat us up if we had diamonds on our watches,And they would take our drugs and money, as they pick our pockets,I guess that that's the privilege of policing for some profit,But thanks to Reaganomics, prisons turned to profits,Cos free labor is the cornerstone of US economics,Cos slavery was abolished, unless you are in prison,You think I am bullshitting, then read the 13th Amendment,Involuntary servitude and slavery it prohibits,That's why they giving drug offenders time in double digits,Ronald Reagan was an actor, not at all a factor,Just an employee of the country's real masters,Just like the Bushes, Clinton and Obama,Just another talking head telling lies on teleprompters,If you don't believe the theory, then argue with this logic,Why did Reagan and Obama both go after Qaddafi,We invaded sovereign soil, going after oil,Taking countries is a hobby paid for by the oil lobby,Same as in Iraq, and Afghanistan,And Ahmadinejad say they coming for Iran,They only love the rich, and how they loathe the poor,If I say any more they might be at my door,Who the fuck is that staring in my window,Doing that surveillance on,Mister Michael Render,I'm dropping off the grid before they pump the lead,I leave you with four words: I'm glad Reagan dead",Reagan,R.A.P.

shall be considered cataclysmic,Countin' packs like a statisician,Emphatic charisma,Savage enigma,I have a religion to handle your rhythm like cannibalism,The camera rollin' and it's time to flow,I don't know,I just go carnival,I'm from Motown you know,I can just line up the hollow tips inside the clip,And I can just go down the road,And knock 'em down like some dominoes,After you already out then I'm dropping some more like you 2Pac and the commandos,Watching my comments like papparazi watching Sasha Obama grow,I got Elijah Mohammed glow,I got the dough these rappers claim they got at the house in my drawer in the envelope,My focus phenomenal,My temperature so hot and cold I broke the thermometer,Guarantee I will kill the flow,This remind me of LaLa Anthony ass in that New Edition movie,Niggas tryin' to cover it up and make her look old,Guarantee I'mma still steal the show,I been had the moves,I remember these bitches was just a dream,Actresses and models I used to only see on television,Now they be climbin' out of my television lookin' at me to get the ring,I remember all I used to be around is dudes that used to try to just kill by me,Choppin' and conceal bodies,Used to clean up the bloody mess up in front of me,I had to holla at a tube,I had to still deal with that field sobriety,Had to do a double take at the dirty mop when he was finished,Looked like Lil Yachty,Nigga, I went to jail for the whole year,I got out and I did the same thing you wack ass rappers do when y'all got your little show here,I came right out to booze/boo's,Straight right out the news,Right off the cover of a magazine,Had the magazine with me at the club showing people like ""Look at this and please try not to drool"",I fuck a Stacy thick ass for all the days she used to make me work,And Tracy slick ass but not before I fuck April first,Translation I'm bout to fool,Y'all countin' me out well I got you,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, here I count for you,Biiitch,[Hook],Last time

that war page with that 24 gauge,But when I double pump it I'm prime Chamberlain,Every track on the record got a background message,""We don't back down ever!"",I'm putting the autobiographical book out with the Book of Ryan,I just let my bitch in LA read, now that sounds epic,My mind carries words,You couldn't walk a mile in my patent leather Larry Bird black con weapons,I hope you know theres more fish that's in the sea,I stole ya ho, we been kissing like we been sitting in a tree,And these ho's in Detroit be trickin' sooo much,They can completely gooo up a magician's sleeve,You're totally awesome,While I pour 40's on corners for those we lost,My soul suffers from holy exhaustion,Trippin' on opium just to cope with openin' coffins,The devil sittin' close enough to me to quote me an offer,Keep the union in unison like the Soviet's marching,We goin' iron for iron like a trophy in golfing,My nigga, better yet, I feel like the only man who can understand me is Sloth from The Goonies,Cause he retarded as fuck, on a boat with a treasure chest,That makes perfectly good sense,That's exactly how my career went,Like a fuckin' experiment,I got a lot on my mind that I gotta deal with,First of all, my favorite uncle died and favorite auntie died,I missed both of they funerals fuckin' around with rappers,So every day and every night my conscience cries,I'm stressed out because my moms be tired, pops be workin',And Lord knows I done threw enough dollars on the floor in the past for moms to retire,That's why I be in the lab and my mind be wired,Trying to figure it out fast before my time expires,Man, but it's this one thing that always on my fucking mind and it haunts me constantly guys,And that's why in the fuck have I not at least tried to get in between Ashanti's thighs,I'm feeling like a straight sucker I faced the vibration,My sober, righteous life only got a place for my lady,But maybe I can ask my lady for permission,She can give me a hall pass like Jason Sudeikis,This audio porn I'm giving with a bit of sense,A mind fuck if you will,I'm from Detroit but if I send you to the store with a large bill for some little shit,Bitch, I was born by a river in a little tent,Now I just ride with six vehicles with an ill tint,I'm cut from the kind of cloth that'll never go outta style,With or without the internet my shit'll still trend,That's why I'm still standing with everything I came with,Cool as a Jacuzzi everything in me is built in,Nah, I don't borrow I'd rather discuss loaning,I'm ready to go to war with whoever the fuck want it,Y'all weigh your respect against your release date,I'm just an artist dog I don't know how to be fake,I don't want no problems dog,I don't wanna be apart of nothing with lies involved,I don't want no phone that receives a thousand calls,I don't need to be around a thousand smiling broads,With they hands out,Probably couldn't survive without em all,But they can't vouch for who the next sucker",Let's Take Them
