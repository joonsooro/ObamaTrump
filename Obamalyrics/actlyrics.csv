Gazapizm,"Kesilmişse cezam boşa temyiz,Düşlerin gereksiz, bir gün değişecek bir şeyler hem de hiç bedelsiz,Biz de gelcez bir gün tüm engelleri geçtik, cengiz,Oralarda esrarengiz olaylar olacak,Pa-pa-para, kalk polisi ara, FBI'ı ara,,ambulansı ara, itfaiyeyi ara, ara düştük yine zara,Bıraksalar çok radikal kararlar alcaz,Buca heykelden otokente otobandan koysak,Arkamızdan korna çalan Ford Connect olcak,Bir konuşsak anlaşsak, kim kontak kuracak,Hiç yoktan pay vercez, iş koycak,Bu da hızlı hayat dezavantajı, ha,tta Abuzer'den halliceyiz hem,vatandaşız. Bir kurşun mu döktürsek? Hep bela başım!,Ne bir servetimiz olcak bizim ne maaşımız yatcak,Bi' de hasret mi sarcak? O gençliğin 20'sinde kahvelerde solcak,Sen de sevdiğine, mahallene düşman olcan,Seni kimse anlamayacak, tek başına kalcan,Gökyüzüne bak gözlerini aç, özlemeyi bırak, bir ma,ganda kurşunusun ya da bir köşede gasp,Bir köşede ailen yok, köşk dediğin park,Bir kağıda adalet yaz, bir köşede yak yak,Bu aralar asabım ve işlerim kesat,Put your hands up, otobanda haze yak,Bir gün gelecek her Barack Obama'dan lanet yağacak,Ve suratına kezzap,Psikolojimiz bozulmuş arkadaşlar, A,$AP Rocky'yi gangsta sananlar var,ama sokakta, yanından geçer kasaplar,Bize anlatılan aynı masallar,What's up, lan?!,Hemen kalk masamdan, paranı yüzüme vurursan kasandan,Olursun bas baya yanımda köpek yok, olsaydı gerek duyardım tasmaya,Beni de kasma ya,Kardeşlerimle gelecem siz köpekleri asmaya,Asya'ya, Avrupa'ya, NASA'ya ateş edelim istersen mafyaya,Laf ya, ağızdan bir kere çıkar, ben,im evime gelirsen babana bi' kere sıkar,giderim, biliderim in derim, rap dediğin dilini keseyim,Beni delirtmeyin sokakları geri verin,Esiri miyiz para yada maddelerin,Beynini sikeyim rüyandaki caddelerin,Hayat dediğin toz pembe değil,arkadaşlarını iyi seç ve kimsye güvenmeyin.,Yıldızlara yakın şehre uzak hayalleri çürüten bi bodrum katta tuzak,Sabah olmıycak kalk,Kaldırım taşları arasından tan sokak lambası patlak,Uzaklaş ordan ışığa doğru koşcan,Soldan ara sokakta beyaz toros sellektör korkcan,Bi deparla korna hiçbir suçun yoksa bike yakalayıp voltaj,Biraz artcak oktav,Köşeyi dön kameraya gülümse,Günün tek aksiyonu sakla yüzün görüncek,Ellerin cebinde başka hiçbir şey yok gözün pek,Kahkahalar duycan oysa hiçbir şey yok gülüncek,Hasbel kader günyüzüne çıksan gözlerin kamaşcak geri karanlığa kacıcan,Hayallerinde görüntü yok bi temassızlık olcak,Bi gün bizde dersek yenildik,Bu zamana kadar koşup yorulmayan eğilsin,Şimdi,Boğazımızdaki halat gerildi,Bu sokaktan ileri o gün beni gasp edecek birileri,Yaz bi kenara bütün bunları,Ağır uykusundan uyanmayan günü kurtarır,Bi kasvete mahkum onlar görüş sonrası,İhtiyaçtan fazlasında gözün olmasın,Karanlık kafanıza aydınlığı çaksın,Kimi zaman ürküyosun bazen bıçaksın,Kaçıcan çato gelip sana delik açacak:/?,Kafanda fur kepini alacak,Yeter yoruldum amk,Yarın devam ederim",Zanı
