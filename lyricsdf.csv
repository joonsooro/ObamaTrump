Mac Miller,"[Verse 1: Mac Miller],Uh, lemme get a one-way ticket, haven't picked a destination,I'm just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station,Packin' no bags, nothin' but the clothes on my back,With a Cognac, let me sip it, tryna to relax,Red wine up in my glass plus Filet Mignon,I got army right up under me, I'm Genghis Khan,Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on,I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't stayin' long,What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?,I told my story, put my life inside this ink pen,Said I'll make it big when, everybody know me,Well, I made it big and, everybody phony,Haha, so could you pour me, I need a cup,No, none of that liquor, mixin' purple stuff,I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much,Go head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free,[Hook],They just dreams, turn 'em to reality,Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony,Looking at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine,All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?,They just dreams, turn 'em to reality,Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony,Looking at the street, thinkin' it could all be mine,All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?,So what the fuck is time?,Ask 'em, what the fuck is time? (x2),[Verse 2: Mac Miller],What do you do when you think you could be an icon?,Because all these people get to screamin' with the lights on,Like they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes, zebra coat,Racin' to the gate but my flight gone,Now these writers taking shots without a Nikon,But I don't fight though, figure it's a typo,Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though,Potion in my sprite, then my night slows, down, down,See, that's exactly what I need,My khaki's filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat,Like it was ""Donald Trump"", a fucking hit but I call it love,They throw it on when I'm walking in the club,Hey, this the Burgh shit, I don't deserve this,Well, I don't think you lookin' for me on the surface,Learn quick, now I'm big time,Fill your cup up, and I'mma sip mine,[Hook],They just dreams, turn 'em to reality,Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony,Looking at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine,All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?,They just dreams, turn 'em to reality,Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony,Looking at the street, thinkin' it could all be mine,All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?,So what the fuck is time?,Ask 'em, what the fuck is time?

Odd Future,"This life is a game if you wanna play,Counting all your own mistakes,Living it with no delay,So fast I'm getting growing pains,Father didn't show me my instincts to take the open lane,I go insane,All the problems come with my growing age,Blowing haze tryna clear the doubt that's sitting on my brain,I don't complain but the kid inside me's feeling so restrained,Gotta stay golden,Let desire rekindle the flame,Searching for the Fountain of Youth,When I'm free in my brain,Bring in the horns,You hear that fucking brass,That's little boy nigga with the trumpets,Marching with the bandwagon,Looking for his heart,No sleeve but his hand carry muskets,Lurking in the meadows, Oblivion,Mothafuck Geppetto, he's a leader not a puppet,Some professors nuttier than Klump's dick,So think before you blink and aye-aye make assumptions,Niggas,Your left, your left, your left, right left,Niggas is coming,Your left, your left, your left, right left,They want a story - a story,I write the shit that I find very amusing,Cause all the other fucking stories are boring,It's really awkward to know that a bunch of kids do adore me,It's like I fathered these fuckers,So you won't find me on Maury,I'm still a kid in my heart so I have a problem maturing,But it will come from experiences and shit I see touring,I'm like a bird when I'm soaring, really high,And I'm really horny, from watching this porn,Nope, but,Bring in the horns,You hear that fucking brass,That's little boy nigga with the trumpets,Marching with the bandwagon,Looking for his heart,No sleeve but his hand carry muskets,Lurking in the meadows, Oblivion,Mothafuck Geppetto, he's a leader not a puppet,Some professors nuttier than Klump's dick,So think before you blink and aye-aye make assumptions,Niggas,Your left, your left, your left, right left,Niggas is coming,Your left, your left, your left, right left,5, 4, 3, 2, and where's Tyler,Bottom of the countdown, shit ain't been the same,Since I found out Hodgy Beats ghost wrote for Bow-Wow,Now I'm the loud shock value style foul mouth fucker,That your teenage kid likes to bow down,Riding around town in Seattle,With the same shotgun that Kurt used to click-clack, boom-pow,Still suicidal but some assume that I'm cool now,Cause I got a fucking award and my own room now,Nope but I can flip shit like a couch pillow,And have my death silent like a loose vowel,The bandwagon turned into caboose, so,So, don't let that little nigga trumpet lose sound, just let him play",Sam (Is Dead)

Common,"After bein' 25, you know, just trying to survive in the world,Bout to have a little boy or baby girl. Who knows?,Anyway, just when you start gettin that little age and experience to,you,You start thinkin about stuff... tryin to make the right moves,So bust it out, this is what I was thinkin, check it,Yo, the education of the Lon-chicka-Lonnie Lynn,Began, began with time,Bein my bloodline is one with the divine,In time brotha, you will discover the light,Some say that God is Black and the Devil's White,Well, the Devil is wrong and God is what's right,I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear,The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear,As a child, given religion with no answer to why,Just told believe in Jesus cuz for me he did die,Curiosity killed the catechism,Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to,And became a slave to master self,A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health,My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons,Koran and the Bible, to me they all vital,And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys,You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief,But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em,And use religion as an emblem,When it should be a natural way of life,Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right,That's who got you doin right and got you this far,Whether you say ""in Jesus name"" or Hum do Allah,Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you,You let that show towards others in the things you do,Cuz when the trumpets blowin, 24 elders surround the throne,Only 144, 000 gon get home,Only 144, 000 gon get home,Only 144, 000 gon get it baby,Cee-Lo:,I've lived and I've learned,I have taken and I've earned,I have laughed, I've cried,I have failed and I have tried,Sunshine, pouring rain,found joy through all my pain,I just wanna be happy with being me,Cee-Lo:,Let me voice my concern,So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title,That their actions didn't earn,Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence,Subconciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince,I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse,place,Cuz it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know,Who you are in the first place,So I try to find the clue in you,But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do,Why're we bein' lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden,Damn, somethin' in me wanna know who I am,So I began my search, my journey started in church,It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief,Hustlin was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets,Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with,And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school,It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only,Science and math are universal,Takin elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran,Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites,Hold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White,Some leads were granted with insight,and it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to overstand,He still created with the imperfection of man,So, with followin' I disagree,By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but,I do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind,That's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas,You gon surely find there's no positivity without negativity,But one side you gonna have to choose,Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse,So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession,become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and,Can't follow your lesson,If a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown,If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own,If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own,If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own,Well, I've lived and I've learned,I've taken and I've earned,I have laughed, I have cried,I failed and I have tried,Sunshine, pourin rain,I found joy through my pain,Just wanna be happy... bein me,Bein me",G.O.D.

Used to tell me, me and Crooked sounded so alike,An 07 XXL shoot, he came over like I'm Crook, I'm like oh hi,Pleasure to meet you brother,Seven years later I'm like wow I met my brother on the freshmen cover,We saw the world together, back of that bus fucking girls together,Got home and broke up with our girls together,Homie, this is special,Y'all rescued me from special forces back home forced to wear a 38 special,Cause none of 'em jam ya',Summer jam was cool but we hung in Japan,I dont think y'all niggas truly understand,I used to think my only way out of the hood was through the number, man,Get drunk and pop shit about runnin' the can,Damn, a whole lot to look forward to,Papi I was going through,What any other thorough nigga in my hood was going thru,The G code I know it's true,You throw at every one of them niggas before they throw at you,Back then I thought that made me real,Listening to myself, now that shit just gave me chills, man,Cause Id've missed this bus,I mean this private jet, no middle seat cause it's just us, shit,All of this cause I can spit,It's crazy how this get when you can say that shit,For the haters being a bitch like he ain't making no cream,I just bought my lady a hit without a radio hit, biatch,I'd rather talk to you niggas,Cause really it could be on the way I'm offin' you niggas, feel me?,And lets just leave it at that,Cause if I decide to crumble paper it ain't to rewrite raps,I got shooters on retainers that would bring me your medulla in containers,Please be on your cool behavior homey!,And lets just leave it at that,I know I said that shit before,But I'm trying to save yall from a war,Yeah you know how you got a Godmother,I got a God grandmother,Attie May Johnson, man, I just got the phone call tonight that she...,She passed away, man, know what I'm sayin'?,She went to the other side,Attie May I still got that brute cologne you bought for me for my birthday,I love you lemme holler,I was opening up a can of spam putting ketchup on fake meat,Still thankful though cause so many hungry nights I ain't sleep,Talking to my cousin before I dropped him off in grape street,He said crook who we gotta kill to get you a Dre beat,Cause I don't wanna see you on this ratchet shit these niggas is on,And how come niggas don't pick up the phone for you to get on a song,I said probably cause I'mma pick 'em apart as soon as I get in the zone,And I definitely didn't condone dick riding so I did it alone,Industry don't want a real nigga to creep in fuck it I'mma sneak in,And fuck going back to that book store I used to sleep in,My homie let me stay on Saturday and Sunday I used to be homeless like the weekend,Same three outfits switching them shits till the week ends,Drowning in my sorrows drinking till I'm sinking in the deep end,Made myself a promise I'mma be the one in the end,With these rehabilitation bars ima' clean 'em up with the pen,Then my problems gonna be over and solved,They finally let me in the damn door now I hope it revolves,Let me out of this mother fucker too many corny ass bitch ass,Kiss ass punk ass buster ass fuck ass niggas,Faggots playing hide the salami,This is a snake business my nigga and I ain't the swami n'aw,This is crooked remember I rap circles around your favourite MC,While calling George Zimmerman a bitch on cable tv,In racially profile hoodie using BETs cypher just to push my agenda,I'm Dominick Wickliffe, I'm James' son,Even though he wore a condom I busted through it I can't forget where I came from,I keep hearing that there's real niggas in the game alright name some,All I know is raps a circus,Your reaching again y'all bleaching your skin y'all bastards searching,For plastic surgeons to make sure that all of your facial features are thin,You're turning Hip-hop to pop you maggots singing again,Just snap your finger and spin,What the fuck you rapping for,And mother fuck a grammy just hand them bitches to Macklemore,I don't need you to tell me that I'm more gifted then a Capricorn,Born before Christmas get it y'all on some nonsense,And I'm the type to laugh soon as I hear about Donald Sterling's bitch choking on Magic's Johnson,(Let me get 'em Crook),I'm cool calm collective smooth,I'm from using coupons with a true mom with infectious views,Number one with you honour and respect the rules,I'm five feet nine inches tall but boy when I'm standing next to dudes,It's like I'm standing on a stepping stool,'Cept when im standing with the wrecking crew,We can turn the tables if we could just make these records move,I know I know it's easier said then done but until the day that I'm done and dead,I'll be remembered by more shit being done then said,Listening to rap you gon' hear lies told,But not from me and not on this this one goes out to every bloggin' columnist around the globe,I want my rhyme flow solidified in time so,I gotta get on my grind bro,I'm thankful for the success that I have with Em' but honestly he could've sold more records than that on his own in a blind fold,And all I'm picturing is my daddy with his arms folded,And looking at me with that look like that's cool but get your own,Confidence breeds success when it's spoke on,Then Patron comes into play then it's postponed,For whatever reason Shady Records still believes in us,And whatever they see in us Interscope don't,Comments being made like niggas old and they pathetic,Now how many times have we proved niggas wrong,And how many niggas you think gon' come out of them offices,And try to show up when we blow up some are gon' even try to take the credit,While we was doing the album the Justice League manager was like,Them niggas album ain't never coming out them niggas don't even like each other,Well fuck the Justice League manager,I would tell you to tell him I said it but talk behind backs is for amateurs,Bitches fake niggas and punks,I don't know it all I just know how to ball and go out and get eight figures in chunks,I'm a fucking warrior I'm a true survivor of having death at your door step, drama in your foyer,That's probably why I looked at that bottle like that's euphoria,When you an addict nobody gotta ask if you wanna' drink that habit will actually ask you for ya,And that'll destroy ya,Take it from a G they call me a soul survivor,Cause my soul done floated on to the crossroads for change more than coal for drivers,I made my oldest a promise,To keep my balls off the net and stay devoted to his Mama,(Let me get 'em Nickle),Tell me what if this is big as I'm supposed to be,I'd hate for that to get confirmed don't take the hope from me,Cause that's a deep threat,I mean I'd like to think that I ain't take a peek at my peak yet I got my feet wet,In '98 they said I was close to my death bed,Vom' and fluid on my cig' it was a meth head,Was hard back then ain't have a car back then,Still in on mase had me wishing I had tvs on the head rest,B.I.G.'s Suicidal Thoughts was getting him through,Would've took my life had id've known who I was giving in to,Mama screaming listen to rules if you gon live in this roof,In retrospect hidden jewel it helped me get in this booth,Now my notoriety trumping how incognito I try to be,Even make my bitches keep it low they on their Nayeli,I don't trust none of these hoes,Sad part is I'm such a tortured soul I had that thought when I proposed,Suited up ring in my hand while in my head I'm saying fuck this bitch,Makes sense that she was thinking even less of me,Got ruined in my youth when the first one got the best of me,When she said she'd never leave then she left fuck y'all expect of me,That resentment only had me fucking different bitches different weeks,But most of them was bad that made it bitter sweet,Those are growing pains call it paying dues,She killed a nigga then birthed one all with the same move,We could hit the hookah spot and do a dinner,But thanks to my baby mother i'll bust anywhere but in her,Cause a baby for her is just a problem i'll be stuck with,Like what gives so n'aw I ain't arrogant but my nut is,I'm scarred happened years ago I'm still effected,If she suck and a swallow then she'll get high it's pill infested,500 proof laced with addict deficiencies,But accent in my son another owed to inconsistency,Ugh' looking at all my life's typos,Just trying to remove the fat provide the lipo',Two words for my enemies die slow,Full time pyros' we do this with our eyes closed,Word up man one more time for the half wits and the simpletons,It go two words for my enemies die slow,Full time fuck it word,La slaughter, La Familia,Ya know what I mean,No matter what we ride, so lets ride",Offshore
