Common,"After bein' 25, you know, just trying to survive in the world,Bout to have a little boy or baby girl. Who knows?,Anyway, just when you start gettin that little age and experience to,you,You start thinkin about stuff... tryin to make the right moves,So bust it out, this is what I was thinkin, check it,Yo, the education of the Lon-chicka-Lonnie Lynn,Began, began with time,Bein my bloodline is one with the divine,In time brotha, you will discover the light,Some say that God is Black and the Devil's White,Well, the Devil is wrong and God is what's right,I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear,The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear,As a child, given religion with no answer to why,Just told believe in Jesus cuz for me he did die,Curiosity killed the catechism,Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to,And became a slave to master self,A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health,My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons,Koran and the Bible, to me they all vital,And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys,You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief,But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em,And use religion as an emblem,When it should be a natural way of life,Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right,That's who got you doin right and got you this far,Whether you say ""in Jesus name"" or Hum do Allah,Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you,You let that show towards others in the things you do,Cuz when the trumpets blowin, 24 elders surround the throne,Only 144, 000 gon get home,Only 144, 000 gon get home,Only 144, 000 gon get it baby,Cee-Lo:,I've lived and I've learned,I have taken and I've earned,I have laughed, I've cried,I have failed and I have tried,Sunshine, pouring rain,found joy through all my pain,I just wanna be happy with being me,Cee-Lo:,Let me voice my concern,So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title,That their actions didn't earn,Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence,Subconciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince,I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse,place,Cuz it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know,Who you are in the first place,So I try to find the clue in you,But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do,Why're we bein' lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden,Damn, somethin' in me wanna know who I am,So I began my search, my journey started in church,It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief,Hustlin was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets,Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with,And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school,It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only,Science and math are universal,Takin elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran,Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites,Hold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White,Some leads were granted with insight,and it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to overstand,He still created with the imperfection of man,So, with followin' I disagree,By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but,I do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind,That's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas,You gon surely find there's no positivity without negativity,But one side you gonna have to choose,Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse,So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession,become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and,Can't follow your lesson,If a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown,If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own,If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own,If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own,Well, I've lived and I've learned,I've taken and I've earned,I have laughed, I have cried,I failed and I have tried,Sunshine, pourin rain,I found joy through my pain,Just wanna be happy... bein me,Bein me",G.O.D.

Used to tell me, me and Crooked sounded so alike,An 07 XXL shoot, he came over like I'm Crook, I'm like oh hi,Pleasure to meet you brother,Seven years later I'm like wow I met my brother on the

beat,Cause I don't wanna see you on this ratchet shit these niggas is on,And how come niggas don't pick up the phone for you to get on a song,I said probably cause I'mma pick 'em apart as soon as I get in the zone,And I definitely didn't condone dick riding so I did it alone,Industry don't want a real nigga to creep in fuck it I'mma sneak in,And fuck going back to that book store I used to sleep in,My homie let me stay on Saturday and Sunday I used to be homeless like the weekend,Same three outfits switching them shits till the week ends,Drowning in my sorrows drinking till I'm sinking in the deep end,Made myself a promise I'mma be the one in the end,With these rehabilitation bars ima' clean 'em up with the pen,Then my problems gonna be over and solved,They finally let me in the damn door now I hope it revolves,Let me out of this mother fucker too many corny ass bitch ass,Kiss ass punk ass buster ass fuck ass niggas,Faggots playing hide the salami,This is a snake business my nigga and I ain't the swami n'aw,This is crooked remember I rap circles around your favourite MC,While calling George Zimmerman a bitch on cable tv,In racially profile hoodie using BETs cypher just to push my agenda,I'm Dominick Wickliffe, I'm James' son,Even though he wore a condom I busted through it I can't forget where I came from,I keep hearing that there's real niggas in the game alright name some,All I know is raps a circus,Your reaching again y'all bleaching your skin y'all bastards searching,For plastic surgeons to make sure that all of your facial features are thin,You're turning Hip-hop to pop you maggots singing again,Just snap your finger and spin,What the fuck you rapping for,And mother fuck a grammy just hand them bitches to Macklemore,I don't need you to tell me that I'm more gifted then a Capricorn,Born before Christmas get it y'all on some nonsense,And I'm the type to laugh soon as I hear about Donald Sterling's bitch choking on Magic's Johnson,(Let me get 'em Crook),I'm cool calm collective smooth,I'm from using coupons with a true mom with infectious views,Number one with you honour and respect the rules,I'm five feet nine inches tall but boy when I'm standing next to dudes,It's like I'm standing on a stepping stool,'Cept when im standing with the wrecking crew,We can turn the tables if we could just make these records move,I know I know it's easier said then done but until the day that I'm done and dead,I'll be remembered by more shit being done then said,Listening to rap you gon' hear lies told,But not from me and not on this this one goes out to every bloggin' columnist around the globe,I want my rhyme flow solidified in time so,I gotta get on my grind bro,I'm thankful for the success that I have with Em' but honestly he could've sold more records than that on his own in a blind fold,And all I'm picturing is my daddy with his arms folded,And looking at me with that look like that's cool but get your own,Confidence breeds success when it's spoke on,Then Patron comes into play then it's postponed,For whatever reason Shady Records still believes in us,And whatever they see in us Interscope don't,Comments being made like niggas old and they pathetic,Now how many times have we proved niggas wrong,And how many niggas you think gon' come out of them offices,And try to show up when we blow up some are gon' even try to take the credit,While we was doing the album the Justice League manager was like,Them niggas album ain't never coming out them niggas don't even like each other,Well fuck the Justice League manager,I would tell you to tell him I said it but talk behind backs is for amateurs,Bitches fake niggas and punks,I don't know it all I just know how to ball and go out and get eight figures in chunks,I'm a fucking warrior I'm a true survivor of having death at your door step, drama in your foyer,That's probably why I looked at that bottle like that's euphoria,When you an addict nobody gotta ask if you wanna' drink that habit will actually ask you for ya,And that'll destroy ya,Take it from a G they call me a soul survivor,Cause my soul done floated on to the crossroads for change more than coal for drivers,I made my oldest a promise,To keep my balls off the net and stay devoted to his Mama,(Let me get 'em Nickle),Tell me what if this is big as I'm supposed to be,I'd hate for that to get confirmed don't take the hope from me,Cause that's a deep threat,I mean I'd like to think that I ain't take a peek at my peak yet I got my feet wet,In '98 they said I was close to my death bed,Vom' and fluid on my cig' it was a meth head,Was hard back then ain't have a car back then,Still in on mase had me wishing I had tvs on the head rest,B.I.G.'s Suicidal Thoughts was getting him through,Would've took my life had id've known who I was giving in to,Mama screaming listen to rules if you gon live in this roof,In retrospect hidden jewel it helped me get in this booth,Now my notoriety trumping how incognito I try to be,Even make my bitches keep it low they on their Nayeli,I don't trust none of these hoes,Sad part is I'm such a tortured soul I had that thought when I proposed,Suited up ring in my hand while in my head I'm saying fuck this bitch,Makes sense that she was thinking even less of me,Got ruined in my youth when the first one got the best of me,When she said she'd never leave then she left fuck y'all expect of me,That resentment only had me fucking different bitches different weeks,But most of them was bad that made it bitter sweet,Those are growing pains call it paying dues,She killed a nigga then birthed one all with the same move,We could hit the hookah spot and do a dinner,But thanks to my baby mother i'll bust anywhere but in her,Cause a baby for her is just a problem i'll be stuck with,Like what gives so n'aw I ain't arrogant but my nut is,I'm scarred happened years ago I'm still effected,If she suck and a swallow then she'll get high it's pill infested,500 proof laced with addict deficiencies,But accent in my son another owed to inconsistency,Ugh' looking at all my life's typos,Just trying to remove the fat provide the lipo',Two words for my enemies die slow,Full time pyros' we do this with our eyes closed,Word up man one more time for the half wits and the simpletons,It go two words for my enemies die slow,Full time fuck it word,La slaughter, La Familia,Ya know what I mean,No matter what we ride, so lets ride",Offshore,House Rules,2014

Goonies,Cause he retarded as fuck, on a boat with a treasure chest,That makes perfectly good sense,That's exactly how my career went,Like a fuckin' experiment,I got a lot on my mind that I gotta deal with,First of all, my favorite uncle died and favorite auntie died,I missed both of they funerals fuckin' around with rappers,So every day and every night my conscience cries,I'm stressed out because my moms be tired, pops be workin',And Lord knows I done threw enough dollars on the floor in the past for moms to retire,That's why I be in the lab and my mind be wired,Trying to figure it out fast before my time expires,Man, but it's this one thing that always on my fucking mind and it haunts me constantly guys,And that's why in the fuck have I not at least tried to get in between Ashanti's thighs,I'm feeling like a straight sucker I faced the vibration,My sober, righteous life only got a place for my lady,But maybe I can ask my lady for permission,She can give me a hall pass like Jason Sudeikis,This audio porn I'm giving with a bit of sense,A mind fuck if you will,I'm from Detroit but if I send you to the store with a large bill for some little shit,Bitch, I was born by a river in a little tent,Now I just ride with six vehicles with an ill tint,I'm cut from the kind of cloth that'll never go outta style,With or without the internet my shit'll still trend,That's why I'm still standing with everything I came with,Cool as a Jacuzzi everything in me is built in,Nah, I don't borrow I'd rather discuss loaning,I'm ready to go to war with whoever the fuck want it,Y'all weigh your respect against your release date,I'm just an artist dog I don't know how to be fake,I don't want no problems dog,I don't wanna be apart of nothing with lies involved,I don't want no phone that

Bag the tree like it's fall?,The girls that was out of my league trying to play with my balls,I pay bills, I work hard, and when my mama cried a river,They never gave us a bridge, they gave us a bridge card,Nigga riding low, puffing on loud,I came way too far to fuck it up now,Text from my mom said me and your grandma proud,I'm way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd,Teacher told me to get a job, save up for 401K,Man, I'd rather be young as shit counting 401k,I'd rather die with a smile instead,I'm just multiplying my money and dividing the legs,I been this way before,Dreamed of havin' so much more,But I'm never dividing the bread,Bitch, I bet I get the debit if I don't get the cred I deserve,Throwing West side up like Pac up,Where they pop your block up, big poppa Flocka,You holy lil whoaty holy kenobi chewbacca,I'm Balenciaga, Chanel, Hermes but I bet you that you won't find it,Rockin' Louis and MCM, I guess I'm clothes-minded,I'm in the Obama suite, you one below in the Joe Biden,I'm in your city just chilling where all your hoes hiding?,20k for the fit because it's 24 carats,I can't lie, the price'll probably go up when I wear it,I'm just D-town repping,Making all these niggas who second-guessed regret it,Regret it like half the hoes I smashed in the sheets,I realize now how much I love Ashley Marie,And when it's all said and done, I'll probably get on my knee,Cause she put up with too many games not to have a ring,Man, she almost cried when she see me on TV on BET,Just making it seem easy! Standing next to Common Sense and Yeezy,I been this way before,Dreamed of havin' so much more,Man, I wake up to a wet dream,Every day's a Friday and every night's a sex scene,Every week is Fashion Week and every day I'm pressed clean,Detroit's angel, I even got red wings,Headed to the ball, me and three prom queens,It's prom night, and guess who's the prom king?,They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King,Everybody know I'm coming soon like Lebron's ring,Tell me that was the verse of the year,Man, that shit deserves a hearse and a tear,Swear to God I'm overlaid, all my girls get overfucked,All my deals be overpaid and all my joints be overstuffed,Finally Famous bitch, there ain't a fucking thing that's over us,So take that check out and owe it up! Man, I turn impossible possible,And what these niggas could barely see into optimal,The same teacher who told me rap is what not to do,Said I'm throwing my life away, if I drop out of school,Want me to come speak to the kids, the point I gotta prove,Is that I did everything they told me not to do,After I went down the road they told me not to cruise,They ain't know that was my road to success,Now my picture on the wall hanging to help the kids follow through,My dream girl is every night, my dream car is optional,My old school look like a T-Rex: I should feed her fossil fuels,Man, I turn my enemies to molecules, lil hoes,Without any preparation, I exceed these expectations,Man they wanna see me dead, but I gave 'em dedication,And I'm yelling fuck 'em all with a hundred exclamations,Cause I'mma be the man til my fucking expiration,I been this way before,Dreamed of havin' so much more,BIG, I do it, this goes out to my muthafucking city of Detroit,Westside to be exact,,right over there on Northlawn",So Much More,Finally Famous,2011
