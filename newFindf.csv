house in my drawer in the envelope,My focus phenomenal,My temperature so hot and cold I broke the thermometer,Guarantee I will kill the flow,This remind me of LaLa Anthony ass in that New Edition movie,Niggas tryin' to cover it up and make her look old,Guarantee I'mma still steal the show,I been had the moves,I remember these bitches was just a dream,Actresses and models I used to only see on television,Now they be climbin' out of my television lookin' at me to get the ring,I remember all I used to be around is dudes that used to try to just kill by me,Choppin' and conceal bodies,Used to clean up the bloody mess up in front of me,I had to holla at a tube,I had to still deal with that field sobriety,Had to do a double take at the dirty mop when he was finished,Looked like Lil

awesome,While I pour 40's on corners for those we lost,My soul suffers from holy exhaustion,Trippin' on opium just to cope with openin' coffins,The devil sittin' close enough to me to quote me an offer,Keep the union in unison like the Soviet's marching,We goin' iron for iron like a trophy in golfing,My nigga, better yet, I feel like the only man who can understand me is Sloth from The Goonies,Cause he retarded as fuck, on a boat with a treasure chest,That makes perfectly good sense,That's exactly how my career went,Like a fuckin' experiment,I got a lot on my mind that I gotta deal with,First of all, my favorite uncle died and favorite auntie died,I missed both of they funerals fuckin' around with rappers,So every day and every night my conscience cries,I'm stressed out because my moms be tired, pops be workin',And Lord knows I done threw enough dollars on the floor in the past for moms to retire,That's why I be in the lab and my mind be wired,Trying to figure it out fast before my time expires,Man, but it's this one thing that always on my fucking mind and it haunts me constantly guys,And that's why in the fuck have I not at least tried to get in between Ashanti's thighs,I'm feeling like a straight sucker I faced the vibration,My sober, righteous life only got a place for my lady,But maybe I can ask my lady for permission,She can give me a hall pass like Jason Sudeikis,This audio porn I'm giving with a bit of sense,A mind fuck if you will,I'm from Detroit but if I send you to the store with a large bill for some little shit,Bitch, I was born by a river in a little tent,Now I just ride with six vehicles with an ill tint,I'm cut from the kind of cloth that'll never go outta style,With or without the internet my shit'll still trend,That's why I'm still standing with everything I came with,Cool as a Jacuzzi everything in me is built in,Nah, I don't borrow I'd rather discuss loaning,I'm ready to go to war with whoever the fuck want it,Y'all weigh your respect against your release date,I'm just an artist dog I don't know how to be fake,I don't want no problems dog,I don't wanna be apart of nothing with lies involved,I don't want no phone that

Hop in my red Porsche,Eat something homie, you look bony and frail,Now why the hell would you take the Oregon Trail?,Remember back in grade school, that stupid computer game?,You shoulda known better, now there's no one but you to blame,Dying of dysentery, don't climb to the enemy,I'ma take you underground where the hive resistance be,Apparently a colony of people are out there,A garden full of veggies, even garlic they sprout there,Leader General Bieber who be running shit down there,Found a way to end the drought, bring out the swimwear,Soon as we pulled up we heard drilling noises,Children started dancing, even grown folk joined in,Like a hydrant in the Bronx, water shot up in the air,But was boiling and as hot as solar flares,Ooowee, ain't that a bitch?,Nobody believed it til the first wave hit,The ground started shaking and the sky went red,(Mayday!

It's kinda loud,Holy shit! There they are right now!,Calm down soldier, this is no time to be a fink,We can beat these clowns, okay, we just need to think,I've lost ten men this week, I can't sleep a wink,But this the last place on earth a guy can get a decent drink,So darned if we lose this bar to those useless zombie bastards,I'd rather starve than be boozeless,So I put barbed wire slabs on the fences,That should buy us some time to plan our defenses,Pick up the chairs and trash cans off the floor,Stack em up on the front door to jam up the entrance,Ain't got grenades but we still might be saved,I just found fifty diet coke cans and some breath mints,Fill the trash cans to the brim with the cola,When the robots break in, toss the mints in the soda,See the blast won't hurt em but it'll get em wet certainly,It'll mess up their wiring and disrupt their circuitry,If it don't work though, my next plan cannot fail,We drink the vodka—shot after shot til we're too drunk to feel pain,Spark up a flame and turn the bottles that remain into Molotov cocktails,I've had it with you clowns, I've reached my limit,You may have killed my captain, but I'm the lieutenant,And I won't let you terrorize us, wait just a minute,That ain't no robot zombie, man, what the hell is it?!,Adam!
